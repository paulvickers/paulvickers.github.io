	Abstract = {Lumbar multifidus (LM) and transversus abdominis (TrA) show altered motor control, and LM is atrophied, in people with low-back pain (LBP). The Functional Re-adaptive Exercise Device (FRED) involves cyclical lower-limb movement against minimal resistance in an upright posture. It has been shown to recruit LM and TrA automatically, and may have potential as an intervention for non-specific LBP. However, no studies have yet investigated the effects of changes in FRED movement amplitude on the activity of these muscles. This study aimed to assess the effects of different FRED movement amplitudes on LM and TrA muscle thickness and movement variability, to inform an evidence-based exercise prescription.},

@article{Madsen:1993,
	Abstract = { This study was designed to investigate empirically the ``aesthetic experience'' as individually defined by each subject. Subjects (N = 30) were faculty members and advanced graduate students at a large university school of music. Each subject listened to a 20-minute excerpt from Act I of Puccini's La Boh{\`e}me and simultaneously manipulated the dial of a Continuous Response Digital Interface (CRDI) to indicate perceived aesthetic level. The CRDI dial represented a negative/positive continuum along a 256-degree arc. Data collected were charted graphically to indicate levels of aesthetic response across time. Subjects completed a questionnaire designed to estimate frequency, duration, location, and magnitude of perceived aesthetic experiences and also indicated whether dial manipulation roughly corresponded to these experiences.Results indicated that there were different responses throughout the excerpt by all subjects. Heightened aesthetic responses were evident during certain parts of the excerpt. ``Peak experiences'' were relatively short (15 seconds or less in duration), preceded by a period of concentrated focus of attention, and generally followed by an ``afterglow'' ranging from 15 seconds to several minutes. All subjects reported having at least one aesthetic experience and also reported that movement of the CRDI dial roughly approximated this experience. ``Aesthetic responses'' for subjects seemed to cluster at many of the same places in the music, with one collective ``peak'' experience that was represented by the highest and lowest dial movements. },

@article{Adams:2006,
	Abstract = {This paper introduces regulatory components influencing city soundscapes in Europe and the UK, illustrating the abatement approach taken within noise policy, demonstrating the importance of individual experience in assessing the soundscapes of urban environments and identifying a terminology to facilitate an introduction of soundscapes into the planning process. Drawing on work from soundscape ecology, a way is demonstrated to coalesce these divergent positions. Reviewing interviews undertaken in Clerkenwell, the paper demonstrates that it is not simply noise levels that are important to people in an urban area. Context, source, distance, temporariness and control over noise, are all relevant to whether people would want to see a particular sound eliminated from their soundscape. Using Schafer's terminology 'keynote sounds', 'soundmarks' and 'sound signals', a rationale is proposed through which experienced soundscapes may be articulated, challenging the strategy of noise abatement which could produce a conformity of soundscape that homogenises place and dissolves local uniqueness.},

	Abstract = {An artist and a biologist have collaborated on the sonification of protein data to produce the audio compact disc "Life Music." Here they describe the process by which this collaboration merges scientific knowledge and artistic expression to produce soundscapes from the basic building blocks of life. The soundscapes may be encountered as aesthetic experiences, as scientific inquiries or as both. The authors describe the rationale both for the artistic use of science and for the scientific use of art from the separate viewpoints of artist and scientist.},

	Abstract = {The authors present a sonification installation that allows a group of players to interact with an auditory display of neural activity. The system is designed to represent electrical spike propagation in a neuron culture through sound propagation in space. Participants can simulate neural spikes by using a set of specially designed controllers, experimenting and sonically investigating the electrical activity of the brain. The article discusses some aesthetic and functional aspects of sonification and describes the authors' approach for group interaction with auditory displays. It concludes with the description of a performance piece for the system and ideas for improvements and future work.},

The authors present two facets of this research that may provide insight into the creative process. First, they discuss aspects of categorical perception in nonverbal auditory scene analysis and propose that these characteristics are simplified models of creative engagement with sound. Second, they describe the use of sonified data in musical compositions by each of the authors and observe aspects of the creative process in the purely aesthetic use of sonified statistical data.},

	Abstract = {Building on our previous work, we extend sonification techniques to common network security data. In this current work, we examine packet flow and the creation of socket connections between a requestor's IP address and port number with the server's IP address and port number. Our goals for the aural rendering are twofold: to make certain conditions immediately apparent to untrained listeners, and to create a sound model capable of enough nuance that there is the possibility of unexpected patterns becoming apparent to a seasoned listener. This system could be used to potentially provide better cognitive refinement capabilities for data fusion systems, especially when multiple sources of data at various levels of refinement are presented to the human analyst.},

	Abstract = {Pulsed Melodic Processing ({PMP)} is a computation protocol that utilizes musically-based pulse sets (``melodies'') for processing -- capable of representing the arousal and valence of affective states. Affective processing and affective input/output are key tools in artificial intelligence and computing. In the designing of processing elements (e.g. bits, bytes, floats, etc.), engineers have primarily focused on the processing efficiency and power. They then go on to investigate ways of making them perceivable by the user/engineer. However Human-Computer Interaction research -- and the increasing pervasiveness of computation in our daily lives -- supports a complementary approach in which computational efficiency and power are more balanced with understandability to the user/engineer. {PMP} allows a user to tap into the processing path to hear a sample of what is going on in that affective computation, as well as providing a simpler way to interface with affective input/output systems. This requires the developing of new approaches to processing and interfacing {PMP-based} modules. In this chapter we introduce {PMP} and examine the approach using three example: a military robot team simulation with an affective subsystem, a text affective-content estimation system, and a stock market tool.},

The power-law exists in the distribution of network behavior's activity according to our empirical study. Besides, it is obvious that there is community effect in network communications. Our results overthrow some usual hypothesises as preconditions of trustworthy network study. It's helpful to assess network vulnerability and to enhance network survivability.},

@article{Kane:2007,
	Abstract = {The work of Pierre Schaeffer (theorist, composer and inventor of musique concr{\`e}te) bears a complex relationship to the philosophical school of phenomenology. Although often seen as working at the periphery of this movement, this paper argues that Schaeffer's effort to ground musical works in a `hybrid discipline' is quite orthodox, modelled upon Husserl's foundational critique of both `realism' and `psychologism'. As part of this orthodoxy, Schaeffer develops his notion of the `sound object' along essentialist (eidetic) lines. This has two consequences: first, an emphasis is placed on `reduced listening' over indicative and communicative modes of listening; secondly, the `sound object' promotes an ahistorical ontology of musical material and technology. Despite frequent references to Schaeffer and the `sound object' in recent literature on networked music, concatenative synthesis and high-level music descriptors, the original phenomenological context in which Schaeffer's work developed is rarely revisited. By critically exploring Schaeffer's theorising of the `sound object', this paper aims at articulating the distance between contemporary and historical usage of the term.},

@article{Hermann:2004b,
	Abstract = {Auditory data display is an interdisciplinary field linking auditory perception research, sound engineering, data mining, and human-computer interaction in order to make semantic contents of data perceptually accessible in the form of (nonverbal) audible sound. For this goal it is important to understand the different ways in which sound can encode meaning. We discuss this issue from the perspectives of language, music, functionality, listening modes, and physics, and point out some limitations of current techniques for auditory data display, in particular when targeting high-dimensional data sets. As a promising, potentially very widely applicable approach, we discuss the method of model-based sonification {(MBS)} introduced recently by the authors and point out how its natural semantic grounding in the physics of a sound generation process supports the design of sonifications that are accessible even to untrained, everyday listening. We then proceed to show that {MBS} also facilitates the design of an intuitive, active navigation through "acoustic aspects", somewhat analogous to the use of successive two-dimensional views in three-dimensional visualization. Finally, we illustrate the concept with a first prototype of a "tangible" sonification interface which allows us to "perceptually map" sonification responses into active exploratory hand motions of a user, and give an outlook on some planned extensions.},

	Abstract = {Narrative visualizations combine conventions of communicative and exploratory information visualization to convey an intended story. We demonstrate visualization rhetoric as an analytical framework for understanding how design techniques that prioritize particular interpretations in visualizations that "tell a story" can significantly affect end-user interpretation. We draw a parallel between narrative visualization interpretation and evidence from framing studies in political messaging, decision-making, and literary studies. Devices for understanding the rhetorical nature of narrative information visualizations are presented, informed by the rigorous application of concepts from critical theory, semiotics, journalism, and political theory. We draw attention to how design tactics represent additions or omissions of information at various levels\&\#8722;the data, visual representation, textual annotations, and interactivity\&\#8722;and how visualizations denote and connote phenomena with reference to unstated viewing conventions and codes. Classes of rhetorical techniques identified via a systematic analysis of recent narrative visualizations are presented, and characterized according to their rhetorical contribution to the visualization. We describe how designers and researchers can benefit from the potentially positive aspects of visualization rhetoric in designing engaging, layered narrative visualizations and how our framework can shed light on how a visualization design prioritizes specific interpretations. We identify areas where future inquiry into visualization rhetoric can improve understanding of visualization interpretation.},

	Abstract = {Previous auditory display research has shown how fundamental aspects of an auditory signal may influence perception and impact the emotional state of the listener. However, a challenge for designers is how to find signals that correspond to user situations and make sense within a user context. In this article we present a web based application called AWESOME Sound Design Tool; a tool that invites users to take part in the design process of auditory signals. The basic idea is to give users control over some aspects of the auditory stimuli and encourage them to manipulate the sound with a specific user scenario in mind. The software may help developers working with applied design to find more appropriate sounds for user situations. It might also help researchers to better understand correlations between the properties of a sound and characteristics of a user situation. A pilot study has been conducted in which car drivers designed warning signals for critical traffic situations. The pilot study illustrated how the tool could be useful for applied audio design.},

	Abstract = {We review a cross-section of subjective experience methods fo- cused on the early conceptual design of auditory displays. The motivation of this review is to support expert and novice design- ers in creating auditory displays in human-computer interaction by introducing them to these methods. A range of available guid- ance and current practice is firstly analysed. Subsequently, the key methods and their concepts are discussed with examples from ex- isting studies. A complementary framework is presented to high- light how these methods can be used together by auditory display designer at the early conceptual design stage. The results from these studies help to demonstrate the need for a greater awareness and use of this type of method in early conceptual design to un- cover pragmatic mental models and associated salient cognitive attributes. The attributes can be related to subjective judgements such as quality, preference, or context among many. This type of approach differs from many quantitative approaches which are strictly focused on the usage aspects of auditory displays. The manner of quantitative approaches is to use hypothesis and valida- tion criteria, however these cannot deal in a structured way with ephemeral judgements such as emotion, mood, or with subject de- pendant information such as tacit knowledge. The increasing use of interactive auditory displays is one area where this type of early conceptual design method can help in ensuring the designed in- teraction and the concrete mapping it uses reflects the considered behaviour of potential users including aspects of the inner needs, desires, and tacit knowledge. This approach will help in consider- ing the emotional, intellectual, and sensual aspects of interactions when designing auditory displays. We close by reflecting on the results and discussing future lines of research using these methods.},

	Abstract = {Computing technologies turn everyday artifacts into narrative, pro- cedural objects. This observation suggests that the narrative sound design strategies used in films and video games could also be ap- plied for the design of interactive commodities. However, it is unknown whether these strategies from immersive media can be applied in physical artifacts of everyday use. In this paper we de- scribe methodological considerations and outline a structure of a revisable, design oriented, participatory research process, which allows to explore narrative sound designs and their possible appli- cation in interactive commodities in a systematic yet explorative way. The process, which focused on interpretational aspects, has been applied in two workshops and their results are reported and discussed.},

	Abstract = {Sonification is still a young research field and many terms such as sonification, auditory display, auralization, audification have been used without a precise definition.  Recent developments such as the introduction of Model-based Sonification, the establishing of interactive sonification and the increased interest in sonification from arts have raised the issue of revisiting the definitions towards a clearer terminology. This paper introduces a new definition for sonification and auditory display that emphasize necessary and sufficient conditions for organized sound to be called sonification. It furthermore suggests a taxonomy, and discusses the relation between visualization and sonification. A hierarchy of closed-loop interactions is furthermore introduced. This paper aims at initiating vivid discussions towards the establishing of a deeper theory of sonification and auditory display.

	Abstract = {Sonification is the use of non-speech audio to convey information. We are developing tools for interactive data exploration, which make use of sonification for data presentation. In this paper, model-based sonification is presented as a concept to design auditory displays. Two designs are described: (1) particle trajectories in a ``data potential'' is a sonification model to reveal information about the clustering of vectorial data and (2) ``data-sonograms'' is a sonification for data from a classification problem to reveal information about the mixing of distinct classes.

@inproceedings{Hermann:2008,
	Abstract = {Sonification is still a young research field and many terms such as sonification, auditory display, auralization, audification have been used without a precise definition.  Recent developments such as the introduction of Model-based Sonification, the establishing of interactive sonification and the increased interest in sonification from arts have raised the issue of revisiting the definitions towards a clearer terminology. This paper introduces a new definition for sonification and auditory display that emphasize necessary and sufficient conditions for organized sound to be called sonification. It furthermore suggests a taxonomy, and discusses the relation between visualization and sonification. A hierarchy of closed-loop interactions is furthermore introduced. This paper aims at initiating vivid discussions towards the establishing of a deeper theory of sonification and auditory display.

	Abstract = {This supersedes Paper 1 (Gutenberg and Richter, 1942). Additional data are presented. Revisions involving intensity and acceleration are minor. The equation log a = I/3 - 1/2 is retained. The magnitude-energy relation is revised as follows:  [IMG] fd1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0">(20)  A numerical equivalent, for M from 1 to 8.6, is  [IMG] fd2.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0">(21)  Equation (20) is based on  [IMG] fd3.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0">(7)  applying at an assumed point epicenter. Eq. (7) is derived empirically from readings of torsion seismometers and USCGS accelerographs. Amplitudes at the USCGS locations have been divided by an average factor of 2 1/2 to compensate for difference in ground; previously this correction was neglected, and log E was overestimated by 0.8. The terms M2 are due partly to the response of the torsion seismometers as affected by increase of ground period with M, partly to the use of surface waves to determine M. If MS results from surface waves, MB from body waves, approximately  [IMG] fd4.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0">(27)  It appears that MB corresponds more closely to the magnitude scale determined for local earthquakes.  A complete revision of the magnitude scale, with appropriate tables and charts, is in preparation. This will probably be based on A/T rather than amplitudes.

	Abstract = {Comprehending a computer program can be a daunting task. There is much to understand, including the interaction among different portions of the code. Program slicing can help one to understand this interaction. Because present-day visual development environments tend to become cluttered, the authors have explored sonification of program slices in an attempt to determine if it is practical to offload some of the visual information. Three slice sonification techniques were developed, resulting in an understanding of how to sonify slices in a manner appropriate for the software developer undertaking program comprehension activities. The investigation has also produced a better understanding of sonification techniques that are musical yet non-melodic and non-harmonic. These techniques were demonstrated to a small set of developers, each reporting that the techniques are promising and useful.},

No self-respecting composer can now function effectively without their favourite computer-based music editor, sequencer, and synthesiser.  Graphical interfaces add a spatial dimension to the compositional process.  The aural dimension offered by music has, however, been largely ignored in interface design.  The human ear is capable of receiving and interpreting exceedingly complex musical sounds, but this capability has never really been exploited.  Why is this, and how might we take advantage of this rich channel of communication?},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes the addition of non-speech sounds to aid people who use scanning as their method of input. Scanning input is a temporal task; users have to press a switch when a cursor is over the required target. However, it is usually presented as a spatial task with the items to be scanned laid-out in a grid.  Research has shown that for temporal tasks the auditory modality is often better than the visual. This paper investigates this by adding non-speech sound to a visual scanning system. It also shows how our natural abilities to perceive rhythms can be supported so that they can be used to aid the scanning process. Structured audio messages called Earcons were used for the sound output. The results from a preliminary investigation were favourable , indicating that the idea is feasible and further research should be undertaken.},
	Address = {Vancouver, BC, Canada},
	Annote = {Walker {\&} Scott suggest that the auditory modality is amore appropriate means of processing information in the temporal domain whereas the visual modality is better in the spatial domain. Wenzel agrees saying "Another advantage of audition is that it is primarily a temporal sense and we are extremely sensitive to changes in acoustic signal over time." Gaver suggests that sound continues over time and as such is good for the display of changing events such as those that occur with the chaning highlight when scanning. Yes},

The two component parts of a compound earcon are played in parallel so that the time taken is only that of a single part.  An experiment was conducted to test the recall and recognition of parallel compound earcons as compared to serial compound earcons.  Results showed that there are no differences in the rates of recognition between the two groups.  Non-musicians are also shown to be equal in performance to musicians.  Some extensions to the earcon creation guidelines of Brewster, Wright and Edwards are put forward based upon research into auditory stream segregation.  Parallel earcons are shown to be an effective means of increasing the presentation rates of audio messages without compromising recognition rates.},

@misc{Burns:1996,
	Annote = {Yes Dear Paul, Yes - it was myself and Prof. John Baldwin on R4. The setup is as follows: We essentially have a Michelson interferometer, working with broad-band light. In order to observe interference fringes, light from each telescope must be in phase when it arrives at the detector. Since one telescope is (slightly!) nearer to the star than the other, we have to introduce some extra path length for that light as compared to the other, when it travels through our optics system. In theory, the extra path necessary can be calculated, and simply introduced by positioning a movable mirror in the correct position. However, the telescope is subject to thermal drifts etc, and the density of the atmosphere is also constantly changing, hence introducting or subtracting relative path between the telescopes, and the fringes are never quite where you predict. In order to find the fringes amidst a strong background and noise, we cause the positionable mirror to oscillate. The period of oscillation is calculated and set such that if it moves through interference fringes, it does so at a frequency of around 700Hz. We simply then play the output from our detector back through a loudspeaker, and listen for a 700Hz signal. If we do not hear a signal, we conclude that the mirror is not quite in the correct position, and move it slightly, while it is still oscillating. If you like, we are using the human auditory system as a fancy filtering system. It appears to be very good at picking out the correct signal, even in VERY poor signal to noise circumstances. In fact, it is not only important for us to know that we are observing the fringes, but also that we are at the centre of the fringe envelope ( the envelope being caused by the pass band of the optical filter we use), and the ear seems to be very good at picking out asymetries in the signal. The distances involved are tiny - the oscillations of the mirror are about typically measured in a few tens of microns (amplitude) and the amount by which we move them is or the order of a few microns. I hope that this helps - please feel free to contact me again if I can help further. My telephone numbers are below.

	Abstract = {The Communicating with Sound panel for CHI'85 will focus on ways of expanding the user interface by using sound as a significant means of output.  As a user's communication from the computer has progressed from large (and often smeary) printout to a teletypewriter and, finally, to the multi-window workstation displays of today, the emphasis has remained primarily on visual output.  Although many user terminals and workstations have the capability of generating sound, that capability is rarely used for more than audio cues (indicating status such as an error condition or task completion) and simple musical tunes.  Research shows that sounds convey meaningful information to users.  With examples of such research, the panel members will demonstrate a variety of uses of sound output, discuss issues raised by the work, and suggest further directions.  The intent of the panel is to stimulate thinking about expanding the user interface and to discuss areas for future research.    In the statements that follow, each panelist will describe his or her own work, including the data and audio dimensions used, the value of the research, remaining issues to be addressed, and suggestions for future research and application.  A list of references is included for those who wish further reading.},

"The multi-dimensionality of sound makes it useful for presenting complex data which is otherwise difficult to represent." Presents a program auralisation taxonomy that divides the programming task into three basic tasks: preparation, execution and review. These three tasks can each be auralised. Execution causes variables and machine state to change over time; the changes can be mapped to sounds to allow execution to be listened to. Review involves the examination of code by scrolling through it. The sequence of program features encountered can be mapped to sound providing contextual information while using the visual information from the screen for detailed assessment.	Preparation (entering or compiling code) can be auralised by mapping tokens encountered to sounds.		LogoMedia helps to pick up syntax errors while entering code. Uses sound effects rather than music. "Comprehending the course of execution of a program and how its data changes is essential to understanding why a program does or does not work. Auralization expands the possible approaches to elucidating program behaviour."

The subjects were required to identify 37 auditory icons by specifying two dimensions: the object associated with producing the sound and the action which could be causing the sound. It was hypothesized that the ecological frequency versus relative uniqueness feature would be more salient for third-graders. Thus, they would be better equipped to identify the auditory cues than the first-graders. The results indicated that the third-grade subjects were better equipped to identify auditory cues based upon two dimensions of interest than the first-grade subjects. This information is useful for interface designers incorporating auditory icons into educational software for children at various developmental levels. Suggestions for future research are provided.},

"Traditional methods of debugging are very time consuming mainly due to the necessity to inspect closely the state at various times during execution of a program." this leads to not seeing the forest for the trees.	Sound can be used to draw our attention to event when we are not looking or paying attention.	Ethos is to use "easy-to-recognize sound patterns to follow the progress of a running program." Rather than using different notes for different functions, the sound of the original function is modulated in different ways by subsequent function calls. This leads to a reduction in the complexity of the sound making it easier, hopefully, to follow and understand. Suggests that smoothly varying sounds are a more effective way to track data than pitch changes, sound effects and melodies. Our PhD should confirm or deny this. Is concerned with interesting events such as when a while loop terminates. This is similar thinking to our "Points of Interest". Before we execute the program we expect it will sound a certain way. If it doesn't then we will have an idea where to search for problems. Auralizations are carried out by impementing a visual programming interface as "a programmer is less likely to use a tool that requires a lot of setting up each time it is used." The idea is not to provide "explicit mappings of interesting values to sounds, but rather allow the use of sounds to detect whether code is executing properly and to give hints where to look for trouble." "A key point is that the user has a reasonably good idea of what he expects to hear once the program starts. Deviations from the expected results are clues that something is not working as expected." - Question - does this only really apply to experts? Will novices really know what to expect????

@incollection{Kramer:1994,

	Annote = {Yes describes a software system for sonification research. Suggests the use of beacons for orientation within an auditory display. Defines audification as a "direct translation of data waveform to the audible domain for purposes of monitoring and comprehension...[T]he data itself is shifted into the audibe domain (multiplied by a time constant to fall between 20Hz and 20KHz), looped (if necessary), converted to the analog domain (if necessary), and amplified. Other than frequency shifting there needs to be no intermediary element." Contrasts this with sonification where data are used to control a sound generator.	Suggests 'parameter nesting' as a way of obtaining "4, 5, or more dimensions out of the most basic variables,such as loudness and pitch."	Beacons are defined (in this context) as auditory events that represent discrete data points or events and thus enable one to identify particular states of a system and thus grasp overall system status and, perhaps, location within the auralization. This seems analogous, if not synonymous, with the auralization of our Points of Interest. As described by Kramer they can act as snapshots of system state at user defined points allowing beacons of successive sonifications to be compared. This acts sort of like a highly abstracted zoom-out facility.	Interesting section on 'affective association'.},

In order to define the main design principles and to choose the input/output device of the interface we used a three-step methodology: analysing offices of visually impaired persons, creating a prototype, evaluating the prototype.  The results of the tests prove that an interface which allows direct manipulation of objects on an electronic desktop, using "earcons" (1) instead of graphical icons and allowing multimodal access to both audio and tactile information, is a good one for blind users.  This test also gives us many practical ideas to improve the device and shows the importance of the participation of users in the design process.},

Listeners rated each sequence on a 6-point scale of "pleasingness". Next, 5 sequences from the original set of 20 were each repeated 10 times in a row and rated after each repetition. The 5 sequences were assigned to listeners so that across listeners the 20 original sequences were equally represented. Finally, all 20 sequences were again each presented once for rating. At all levels of musical training, listeners showed a monotonic relationship between "pleasingness" and level of harmonic structure, with highest ratings of "pleasingness" associated with the highest level of structure. During repeated exposures, judged "pleasingness" increased at all levels of harmonic structure except the highest level, where a decrease of "pleasingness" with exposure was obtained. The effects of repetition did not, however, extend to the final ratings of the original set of 20 sequences. The data are discussed with reference to the optimal-complexity model of aesthetic judgement; specific attention is directed toward the cognitive processes determining sequence complexity.},

Focus is on data sonification rather than program auralization which poses a different set of problems. "MIDI is adequate for the development of toy or demonstration systems, but it is clearly inadequate for the development of production-quality systems to be used for scientific work." Perhaps, but this suggests that music is a good medium to use as it can easily be generated using the MIDI language; music would not require complex manipulation of sound in real time. 	Proposes 8 steps in designing an experiment into auditory display:	1. stating a hypothesis 2. specifying the parameters of the data that must be manufactured. 3. specifying what will vary from test case to test case. 4. selecting or designing one or more auditory attributes to use. 5. specifying how data fields will be associated with the auditory attributes. 6. selecting an experimental protocol for presenting test cases. 7. specifying what will be measured and how the measurements will be recorded. 8. selecting test subjects.},
