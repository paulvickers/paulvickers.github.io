IKO is a revolutionary 3D audio speaker designed and built by [Sonible](https://iko.sonible.com/en.html) in Graz, Austria. The Department of Computer and Information Sciences at Northumbria University is proud to own the only IKO in the UK where it is being used for collaborative and interdisciplinary research in fields such as data sonification, auditory perception, spatial audio, electroacoustic music, and more. IKO uses ambisonic beamforming to create a very tangible three-dimensional immersive sound field, the experience of which is very different from traditional multi-speaker arrays.
