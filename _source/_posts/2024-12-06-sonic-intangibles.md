## New Interdisciplinary Research Project"

I am pleased to announce that I will be leading a new research project beginning in February, 2025. *Sonic intangibles: Northumbria and Newcastle Universities Sonification Hub for Innovation in Sound and Meaning* has been awarded funding under Round 1 of the new [UKRI Cross Research Council Responsive Mode Scheme](https://www.ukri.org/news/first-projects-from-ukris-new-interdisciplinary-scheme-announced/){:target="_blank"}. This two-year project brings together sonification researchers at Northumbria University and Newcastle University to focus on new interdisciplinary ways of working for conducting successful sonification design projects.
