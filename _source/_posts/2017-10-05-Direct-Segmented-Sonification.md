Following a research visit I made in the spring of this year to the 
[Institute of Electronic Music and Acoustics](http://iem.kug.ac.at/en/institute-of-electronic-music-and-acoustics.html)
 at the Kunst Uni Graz, [Robert Höldrich](http://iem.kug.ac.at/en/people.html?tx_kugpeople_pi1%5Bperson_nr%5D=50114&cHash=eb4d7486e953326e239071165ea47ccf)
 and I have been collaborating on a new sonification technique
that picks out regions of interest in a signal while preserving the original temporal regime. Called
Direct Segmented Sonification, it leverages the directness of audification while using
a modified auditory graphing approach to sonify segments of the original data signal
while preserving the original temporal regime. Read more on the [DSSon project page](/DSSon). From there you will find a link to the project's 
github repository which contains source code and audio examples. A paper on the technique 
is currently under review.
