## RADICAL: A Radical New Interdisciplinary Space for Sonification
Department of Computer and Information Sciences
Northumbria University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK

I am pleased to announce a forthcoming research project to develop a fundamental understanding of the relationship between sonification design and the listener and to stimulate a revitalised agenda for sonification research and practice.

Project RADICAL is funded by a three-year Research Project Grant by the Leverhulme Trust (RPG-2020-113) and will commence in October 2020. 

Bringing together researchers in sonification, music practice, listening, aesthetics, and ethnography at Northumbria University and Newcastle University, and using Northumbria's [IKO 3D loudspeaker](https://paulvickers.github.io/iko/) RADICAL will create a new space for sonification research. 

For further information about the project and about two new post-doctoral research posts that we are recruiting to, please see the [project RADICAL page](/radical/).
