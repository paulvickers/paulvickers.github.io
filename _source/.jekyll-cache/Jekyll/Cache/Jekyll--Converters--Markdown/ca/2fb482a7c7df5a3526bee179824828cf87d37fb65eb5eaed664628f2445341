I"Þ<p>Following a research visit I made in the spring of this year to the 
<a href="http://iem.kug.ac.at/en/institute-of-electronic-music-and-acoustics.html">Institute of Electronic Music and Acoustics</a>
 at the Kunst Uni Graz, <a href="http://iem.kug.ac.at/en/people.html?tx_kugpeople_pi1%5Bperson_nr%5D=50114&amp;cHash=eb4d7486e953326e239071165ea47ccf">Robert HÃ¶ldrich</a>
 and I have been collaborating on a new sonification technique
that picks out regions of interest in a signal while preserving the original temporal regime. Called
Direct Segmented Sonification, it leverages the directness of audification while using
a modified auditory graphing approach to sonify segments of the original data signal
while preserving the original temporal regime. Read more on the <a href="/DSSon">DSSon project page</a>. From there you will find a link to the projectâ€™s 
github repository which contains source code and audio examples. A paper on the technique 
is currently under review.</p>
