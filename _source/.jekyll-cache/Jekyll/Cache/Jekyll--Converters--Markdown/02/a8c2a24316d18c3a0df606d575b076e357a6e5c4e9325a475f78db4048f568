presents an overview of the issues, methods, and approaches crucial for the study of sound in artistic practice.

  <p>The collection is organized around six main themes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Sounding Art: The notion of sounding art, its relation to sound studies, and its evolution and possibilities.</li>
    <li>Acoustic Knowledge and Communication: How we approach, study, and analyze sound and the challenges of writing about sound.</li>
    <li>Listening and Memory: Listening from different perspectives, from the psychology of listening to embodied and technologically mediated listening.</li>
    <li>Acoustic Spaces, Identities and Communities: How humans arrange their sonic environments, how this relates to sonic identity, how music contributes to our environment, and the ethical and political implications of sound.</li>
    <li>Sound Technologies and Media: The impact of sonic technologies on contemporary culture, electroacoustic innovation, and how the way we make and access music has changed.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>With contributions from leading scholars and cutting-edge researchers, The Routledge Companion to Sounding Art is an essential resource for anyone studying the intersection of sound and art.</p>
