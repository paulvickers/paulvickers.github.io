David Worrall and I guest-edited the April 2017 special isse of the journal Displays on the 
sonification of real-time data. This special issue presents five articles drawn from
across the range of sonification practice but which all focus on how to communicate
information about real-time data.

The contents are as follows:

1. "[Preface to the Special Issue on Sonification](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141938216302244)" by Paul Vickers, David Worrall, and Richard So.
2. "[Comparative study on the effect of Parameter Mapping Sonification on perceived instabilities, efficiency, and accuracy in real-time interactive exploration of noisy data streams](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141938216300634)" by David Poirier-Quinot, Gaetan Parseihian, and Brian F.G. Katz.
3. "[Sonification of a networkâ€™s self-organized criticality for real-time situational awareness](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141938216300646)" by Paul Vickers, Chris Laing, and Tom Fairfax.
4. "[Towards a systematic approach to real-time sonification design for surface electromyography](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141938216300828)" by S. Camille Peres, Daniel Verona, Tariq Nisar, and Paul Ritchey.
5. "[The sound of smile: Auditory biofeedback of facial EMG activity](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141938216301652)" by Yuki Nakayama, Yuji Takano, Masaki Matsubara, Kenji Suzuki, and Hiroko Terasawa.
6. "[EcoSonic: Auditory peripheral monitoring of fuel consumption for fuel-efficient driving](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141938216301949)" by Jan Hammerschmidt and Thomas Hermann.
