<p>Department of Computer and Information Sciences
Northumbria University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK</p>

<p>I am pleased to announce a forthcoming research project to develop a fundamental understanding of the relationship between sonification design and the listener and to stimulate a revitalised agenda for sonification research and practice.</p>

<p>Project RADICAL is funded by a three-year Research Project Grant by the Leverhulme Trust (RPG-2020-113) and will commence in October 2020.</p>

<p>Bringing together researchers in sonification, music practice, listening, aesthetics, and ethnography at Northumbria University and Newcastle University, and using Northumbriaâ€™s <a href="https://paulvickers.github.io/iko/">IKO 3D loudspeaker</a> RADICAL will create a new space for sonification research.</p>

<p>For further information about the project and about two new post-doctoral research posts that we are recruiting to, please see the <a href="/radical/">project RADICAL page</a>.</p>
