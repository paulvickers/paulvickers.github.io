moson (micro-organism sonification) is a collection of auditory display tools for the 
sonification and audification of atomic force microscope data recordings of the micro 
organism Dunaliella salina by Richard Thompson at the University of Durham's Department 
of Chemistry. The auditory display aspects are part of Louise Mackenzie's larger [Microbial 
Sensing](http://www.viralexperiments.co/#!viral-experiment-2/cle2) research project.

The auditory displays in moson were featured in Mackenzie's [Stars Beneath our Feet](http://www.lumiere-festival.com/programme/durham/the-stars-beneath-our-feet/) 
installation originally commissioned by Artichoke for [Lumiere Durham 2015](http://www.lumiere-festival.com/durham-2015/).

The sonification tool `BacteriaActivity` is a patch for Max/MSP. The audification tool 
`Audify` is a Python executable.
