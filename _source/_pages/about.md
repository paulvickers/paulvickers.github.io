My name is Paul Vickers and I am Associate Professor & Reader in Computer Science & 
Computational Perceptualisation at Northumbria University in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.

I work in the Department of [Computer & Information Sciences](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/academic-departments/computer-science-and-digital-technologies/) 
in the Faculty of Engineering and Environment at [Northumbria University](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/). I also have an 
[official university web page](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/our-staff/v/dr-paul-vickers/).

I am the Lead for Northumbria's [Digital Living](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/research/research-themes/theme-2/) multidisciplinary research theme.

Prior to October 2001 I worked for 12 years in the School of Computing & Mathematical Sciences at Liverpool John Moores University.

I am a computer scientist. I am a chartered engineer. I teach and research in the computing domain where it intersects with creative digital media. For instance, I teach introductory digital audio, I conduct research into how to use sound to communicate data and information (sonification) and I also look at how the aesthetic properties of scientific artefacts affect how they may be used, that is, how people interact with them. 

I collaborate with computer and network security specialists, with 3D modellers and digital special effects experts, with musicians, with artists, and, of course, with other computer scientists and engineers.

I am also a board member of the [International Community for Auditory Display](http://www.icad.org) 2004-2012, 2015-.
