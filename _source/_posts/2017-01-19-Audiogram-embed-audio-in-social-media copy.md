We know as sonification researchers that social media platforms prefer video over audio. This
is frustrating as we want to be able, say, to embed sonification examples in our Tweets.

Well, now we can thanks to New York Public radio who have created an open source tool to 
convert audio into video which can be embedded in social media. The tool is called
[Audiogram](https://medium.com/@WNYC/socialaudio-e648e8a5f2e9#.xi3wf2nst) and you can get it from their [git repo](https://github.com/nypublicradio/audiogram).

[Here's a Tweet](https://twitter.com/DrPaulVickers/status/822066017283215361) with it in action.
