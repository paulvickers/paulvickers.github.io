I"Ä<p>My name is Paul Vickers and I am Professor of Computer Science &amp; 
Sonification at Northumbria University in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.</p>

<p>I work in the Department of <a href="https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/academic-departments/computer-and-information-sciences/">Computer &amp; Information Sciences</a> 
in the Faculty of Engineering and Environment at <a href="https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/">Northumbria University</a>. I also have an

I am the author of <a href="http://www.howtothinklikeaprogrammer.com">How To Think Like A Programmer</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to October 2001 I worked for 12 years in the School of Computing &amp; Mathematical Sciences at Liverpool John Moores University.</p>

<p>I am a computer scientist. I am a chartered engineer. I teach and research in the computing domain where it intersects with creative digital media. For instance, I teach introductory digital audio, I conduct research into how to use sound to communicate data and information (sonification) and I also look at how the aesthetic properties of scientific artefacts affect how they may be used, that is, how people interact with them.</p>

<p>I collaborate with computer and network security specialists, with 3D modellers and digital special effects experts, with musicians, with artists, and, of course, with other computer scientists and engineers.</p>

<p>I also served as a board member of the <a href="http://www.icad.org">International Community for Auditory Display</a> 2004-2012, 2015-2018, 2019â€“2022.</p>
