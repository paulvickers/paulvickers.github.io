I"e<p>Clemens Wollner has edited a terrific volume entitled <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Body-Sound-and-Space-in-Music-and-Beyond-Multimodal-Explorations/Wollner/p/book/9781472485403"><em>Body, Sound and Space in Music and Beyond: Multimodal Explorations</em></a>
which has been published by Routledge. With Bennett Hogg and David Worrall, I co-wrote Chapter 6,
<em>Aesthetics of sonification: Taking the subject-position</em> which takes forward my
work on sonification aesthetics and proposes a way of considering sonification design that
may help to bring the listener’s past experience into the listening experience.</p>

<p>Here’s the blurb about the book from its website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Body and space refer to vital and interrelated dimensions in the experience of sounds
and music. Sounds have an overwhelming impact on feelings of bodily presence and 
inform us about the space we experience. Even in situations where visual information 
is artificial or blurred, such as in virtual environments or certain genres of film 
and computer games, sounds may shape our perceptions and lead to surprising new 
experiences. This book discusses recent developments in a range of interdisciplinary 
fields, taking into account the rapidly changing ways of experiencing sounds and 
music, the consequences for how we engage with sonic events in daily life and the 
technological advancements that offer insights into state-of-the-art methods and 
future perspectives. Topics range from the pleasures of being locked into the beat 
of the music, perception–action coupling and bodily resonance, and affordances of 
musical instruments, to neural processing and cross-modal experiences of space and 
pitch. Applications of these findings are discussed for movement sonification, room 
acoustics, networked performance, and for the spatial coordination of movements in 
dance, computer gaming and interactive artistic installations.</p>
