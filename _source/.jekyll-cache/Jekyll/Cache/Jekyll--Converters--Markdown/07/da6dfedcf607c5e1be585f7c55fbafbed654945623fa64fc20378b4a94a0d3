I"Œ<p>A little while I was interviewed by <a href="http://creativedisturbance.org/people/scot-gresham-lancaster/">Scot Gresham-Lancaster</a> for his Sound and Data 
sonification podcast. The <a href="http://creativedisturbance.org/podcast/dr-paul-vickers-sonification-ethical-computing-and-standup-comedy-eng/">interview is now live</a>
so I encourage you to listen to it. All feedback welcome.</p>
