A little while I was interviewed by [Scot Gresham-Lancaster](http://creativedisturbance.org/people/scot-gresham-lancaster/) for his Sound and Data 
sonification podcast. The interview is now [live](http://creativedisturbance.org/podcast/dr-paul-vickers-sonification-ethical-computing-and-standup-comedy-eng/)
so I encourage you to listen to it. All feedback welcome.
