<p>IKO is a revolutionary 3D audio speaker designed and built by
<a href="https://iko.sonible.com/en.html">Sonible</a> in Graz, Austria. The Department of
Computer and Information Sciences at Northumbria University is proud to own the
only IKO in the UK where it is being used for collaborative and
interdisciplinary research in fields such as data sonification, auditory
perception, spatial audio, electroacoustic music, and more. IKO uses ambisonic
beamforming to create a very tangible three-dimensional immersive sound field,
the experience of which is very different from traditional multi-speaker arrays.</p>

<h2 id="workshops">Workshops</h2>
<p>Past and forthcoming workshops based around the Northumbria are listed below. If
you are interested in running or attending a workshop (either here in Newcastle
or elsewhere in the UK) please contact <a href="mailto:paul.vickers@northumbria.ac.uk?subject=[IKO Workshop]">Paul

<h2 id="setting-up-iko-and-software-configuration">Setting up IKO and software configuration</h2>

<p>Setting up IKO requires physical arrangement and connection of the hardware and
setting up the host computerâ€™s software environment to drive IKO.</p>

<h3 id="physical-setup">Physical setup</h3>
<p>IKO is a heavy instrument and requires two people to set it up safely. Sonible
have produced an excellent instructional video on how to set up and break down
an IKO installation.</p>

<p>Once the IKO is positioned on its stand and connected to the d:24 amplifier,
connect the amp to the host computer with a suitable multi-channel audio
interface. At Northumbria we use the <a href="https://www.rme-audio.de/madiface-usb.html" target="\_blank">RME MADIface</a>.</p>

<h3 id="software-setup">Software setup</h3>
<p>The <a href="/assets/files/IKO_HowTo_Software_0.05.pdf">Quick Start Guide</a> in the IKO
user manual contains full instructions on how to set up a DAW and the necessary
plugins to drive IKO.</p>
