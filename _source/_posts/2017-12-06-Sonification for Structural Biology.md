title: "Sonification for Structural Biology and Structure-based Drug Design"
excerpt: "The visualisation of structural biology data can be quite challenging as the datasets
are complex, in particular the intrinsic dynamics/flexibility. Therefore some
researchers have looked into the use of sonification for the display of proteins."
