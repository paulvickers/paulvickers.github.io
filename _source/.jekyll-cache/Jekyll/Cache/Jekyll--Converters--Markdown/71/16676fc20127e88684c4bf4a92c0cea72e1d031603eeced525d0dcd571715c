I" <p>The <a href="https://paulvickers.github.io/SoniFRED/">soniFRED project</a> is a piece of 
collaborative research between Northumbria Universityâ€™s Department of Computer and 
Information Sciences and the <a href="http://www.aerospacemed.rehab/">Aerospace Medicine and Rehabilitation Lab</a>.</p>

<p>We spent a week at the <a href="https://www.life.org.uk/">Centre for Life</a>
testing different information presentation methods to help people with low back pain
exercise most effectively with the Functional Re-adaptive Exercise Device (FRED). Combinations
of visual and auditory feedback (including two sonification schemes) were given to 
participants and the data will be analysed to see what ways of giving the users feedback
about how they are using the machine lead to improved performance.</p>

<p>You can get a sense of what we were doing by watching this <a href="https://vimeo.com/219668024">short video</a>.</p>
