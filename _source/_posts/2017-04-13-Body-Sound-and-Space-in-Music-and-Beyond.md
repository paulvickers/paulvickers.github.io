Clemens Wollner has edited a terrific volume entitled [*Body, Sound and Space in Music and Beyond: Multimodal Explorations*](https://www.routledge.com/Body-Sound-and-Space-in-Music-and-Beyond-Multimodal-Explorations/Wollner/p/book/9781472485403)
which has been published by Routledge. With Bennett Hogg and David Worrall, I co-wrote Chapter 6,
*Aesthetics of sonification: Taking the subject-position* which takes forward my
work on sonification aesthetics and proposes a way of considering sonification design that
may help to bring the listener's past experience into the listening experience. 

Here's the blurb about the book from its website:

>Body and space refer to vital and interrelated dimensions in the experience of sounds
>and music. Sounds have an overwhelming impact on feelings of bodily presence and 
>inform us about the space we experience. Even in situations where visual information 
>is artificial or blurred, such as in virtual environments or certain genres of film 
>and computer games, sounds may shape our perceptions and lead to surprising new 
>experiences. This book discusses recent developments in a range of interdisciplinary 
>fields, taking into account the rapidly changing ways of experiencing sounds and 
>music, the consequences for how we engage with sonic events in daily life and the 
>technological advancements that offer insights into state-of-the-art methods and 
>future perspectives. Topics range from the pleasures of being locked into the beat 
>of the music, perceptionâ€“action coupling and bodily resonance, and affordances of 
>musical instruments, to neural processing and cross-modal experiences of space and 
>pitch. Applications of these findings are discussed for movement sonification, room 
>acoustics, networked performance, and for the spatial coordination of movements in 
>dance, computer gaming and interactive artistic installations.
