![image-left](/images/chisonUI.jpg){: .align-right}The visualisation of structural biology data can be quite challenging as the datasets
are complex, in particular the intrinsic dynamics/flexibility. Therefore some
researchers have looked into the use of sonification for the display of proteins.
Combining sonification and visualisation appears to be well fitted to this problem, but
at the time of writing there were no plugins available for any of the major molecular
visualisation applications. Therefore, we set out to develop a sonification plugin for
one of those applications, released as open-source software, in order to facilitate
scrutiny and evaluation from as many parties as possible. Our open
source sonification plugin was developed for UCSF Chimera  in collaboration
with medicinal chemists and structural biologists. We determined two tasks that we
deemed were not well represented visually and developed sonifications for them.
Furthermore, we extended a general-purpose Chimera tool to map attributes of protein
residues to pitch.
